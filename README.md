## Introduction
🟣 **MMEDIT** is a state-of-the-art audio generation model built upon the powerful [Qwen2-Audio 7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-Audio-7B). It leverages the robust audio understanding and instruction-following capabilities of the large language model to achieve precise and high-fidelity audio editing.

## 📂 Data Preparation

For detailed instructions on the data pipeline, and dataset structure used for training, please refer to our separate documentation:

👉 **[Data Pipeline & Preparation Guide](./docs/DATA_PIPELINE.md)**


## ⚡ Quick Start




### 1. Inference
You can quickly generate example audio with the following code:

```
bash bash_scripts/infer_single.sh
```

The output will be save at inference/example


---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Configuration
Before running inference or training, please check `configs/config.yaml`. The project uses `hydra` for configuration management, allowing easy overrides via command line.

### 2. Inference
To run batch inference using the provided scripts:

```bash
cd src
bash bash_scripts/inference.sh
```

### 3. Training
Ensure you have downloaded the **Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct** checkpoint to `./ckpt/qwen2-audio-7B-instruct` and prepared your data according to the [Data Pipeline Guide](./docs/DATA_PIPELINE.md).

```bash
cd src
# Launch distributed training
bash bash_scripts/train_dist.sh
```

---

## 📝 Todo
- [ ] Release inference code and checkpoints.
- [ ] Release training scripts.
- [ ] Add HuggingFace Gradio Demo.
- [ ] Release evaluation metrics and post-processing tools.
